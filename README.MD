#Hello everyone!
I am new to Github, so first of all, I just tried to push my html/css practices (zero to hero practices) as a test for the github repositories (yeah what a giant step XD).

So to explain these files, I had to say that they are just my notes based on what I'm learning about html and css, maybe it's interesting to take a look at them, but there is nothing special in most of my files, they're just my notes and practices.
